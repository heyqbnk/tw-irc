# TODO
Here is a list of features that must be realized in the future. Watch for
[updates history](https://github.com/wolframdeus/tw-irc/blob/master/updates-history.md) to
stay informed.

1. Workaround with PRIVMSG (chat rooms). A lot of changes should come in
the feature.

2. Make CLEARMSG delete all user's messages. At this time we can delete only
one.

3. Rework `/followers` command. We are not able to set `duration` which
is equal to required following time.

4. Create `ChannelController` which can be created from `Client`. It will
allow to control channel directly (`v2` or `v3` feature maybe).
